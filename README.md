I have used the official Bullet Journal Companion app for a long time now, and I have always wished I could turn off the 72 hour expiration of entries.

I know the intent with the 72 hour limit is to push you to transfer to your journal every day, but my life doesn't always lend to that.

I decided to create this simple app for my on the go bullet journal needs. You can add/edit notes, tasks, and events, and delete them when you're ready.

This site is a PWA, meaning you can install it to your device in Android and it will look and act like a native application.
